# Beyond Coding: Essential Skills for Software Engineers
# Introduction

Writing code is hard. Writing easily extendable and maintainable standards compliant code to tight deadlines is extremely hard. Systems need to elagantly designed, high performing, scalable and useable, supported by tests and documentation. Technology and tools are continually evolving, coming in and out of favour with the developer community. A Software Engineer must work hard to keep up with industry trends while applying their craft under significant pressures from the organisation they are working for. There is no denying the significance of the 'hard' technical and logical skills required for a successful career in Software Engineering. Being a Software Engineer is hard. Very hard.

This book goes beyond the hard technical work of coding, and considers the importance of paying attention to those abilities which often come under the banner of 'soft' skills. We will argue that these are actually 'essential' skills for a Software Engineer to be more effective, with more engagment in their day-to-day work, and to significantly enhance their career progression prospects.

By soft skills, or the term we prefer 'Essential Skills' we are talking about the 'dark arts' of Getting the communications right; Advertising ourselves and our succeses; Designing solutions and planning our work; Organisation and timekeeping; Critical thinking; Navigating cross-departmental politics; Improving our workflows and processes; Collaborative working; Taking ownership and responsibility; Looking after our health and wellbeing; Self awareness...

There are situaltional constraints and personal constraints to consider.

Developing soft skills does does not come easy to everyone. You can go on courses or be told to do more of this or that by your manager, but for many people in the it's difficult to change our ways. Many of us lack the appreciation of soft skills and the awareness of our capabilities.

Here we'll be pondering the importance of all the periphery skills... etc.
